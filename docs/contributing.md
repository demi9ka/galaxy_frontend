- commit message should be started with:
  - `[+]` - something added
  - `[-]` - something removed
  - `[f]` - something fixed
  - `[u]` - something updated
  - `[r]` - something refactored

- commit messages lowercase only
- do not push to `main` branch, use `dev` branch
- commits should be as small as possible
- 10 little commits are better then 1 big commit
