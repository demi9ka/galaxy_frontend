- commit message should be started with:
  - `[+]` - something added
  - `[-]` - something removed
  - `[f]` - something fixed
  - `[u]` - something updated
  - `[r]` - something refactored

- commit messages lowercase only
- do not push to `main` branch, use `dev` branch
- commits should be as small as possible
- 10 little commits are better then 1 big commit
- we don't use docker, we use podman only
- use `'` instead of `"`

## important files

- `src/App.tsx` - logic
- `src/styles/index.css` - css theming
- `src/main.tsx` - imports
- `src/assets/*` - assets
